This addon is made by RE RE.


This addon comes with the On Screen console seen on script fodder.
It also comes with teleport/warp locations that save and only need to be programed once.
This addon uses ulx so if you don't use ulx then you are SOL...
You dont need to have a data base to set this up all the files warps are stored in a txt file.

Simply throw the re_OSC into your addons, that simple.

To customise the On Screen Console edit the config.lua (re_OSC\lua\autorun\config.lua)

To customise the Warps menu siply edit the re_warp_config.lua (re_OSC\lua\ulx\modules\sh\re_warp_config.lua)

To warp your self simply type !warp <location>
To warp others simply type !warpuser <user> <location>
To open the warps menu type !warps
To add a warp type !addwarp <name> <groups> or open the ulx menu and find the warps tab and enter the group(s) you would like to be able to warp to the location.  
If you want to have more than one group to access that warp simply use a space between the names. DO NOT use a comma (,)


If you have any questions ask on script fodder thanks!
