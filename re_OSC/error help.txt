If you are getting an error thats similar to this:

 [ERROR] lua/vgui/dframe.lua:101: bad argument #1 to 'SetText' (string expected, got nil)
  1. SetText - [C]:-1
   2. SetTitle - lua/vgui/dframe.lua:101
    3. CreateReLogConsoleUI - addons/re_osc/lua/autorun/client/cl_vgui.lua:83
     4. ShowReLogConsoleUI - addons/re_osc/lua/autorun/client/cl_vgui.lua:107
      5. unknown - LuaCmd:1

It's because your server want's to be a pain in the ass and not read the congif files.

What you need to do is 1 of 2 things either have me fix it but it could take a little more time for me to get back 
to you, or you can do it your self its pretty easy.  Just take all the config and put it in manually.
What this means is for example the first line of the config is this:

serverName = "RE RE's On Screen Console"

You need to find where "serverName" is in the cl_vgui.lua

In this case it is line 83: re_log_frame:SetTitle( serverName ) change where it says serverName to (string) 
"RE RE's On Screen Console" What ever you have in the quotes. You will need to do this with every config item.

If this is not your error contact me on scriptfodder please and thankyou!
